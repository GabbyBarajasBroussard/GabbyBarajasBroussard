### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
#### My name is Gabby Barajas-Broussard and ever since I was a child, I have been passionate about helping others. In my late teen years, I found myself drawn to the field of nursing and in college I pursued my goal of becoming a Neonatal ICU Registered Nurse. After about two years of being a RN, I obtained national certification in my field to show my commitment to the care of high risk infants. I still had a yearning to help more and that is what drew me to Codeup. I learned about their Data Science Bootcamp and I found myself drawn to the field. As my completion of the bootcamp draws near, I am hoping to pursue a data scientist role in healthcare to improve patient care and outcomes.
